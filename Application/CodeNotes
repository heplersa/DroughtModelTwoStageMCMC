This folder contains files to replicate the results of the application from the paper "Recursive MCMC for Fast Bayesian Inference of Large Spatio-temporal Ordinal Data, with Application to US Drought" by Staci Hepler and Robert Erhardt.

## Raw Data: USDMDataAvg.csv downloaded from Data Dryad doi:10.5061/dryad.g1jwstqw7
This combines rasterized USDM with NLDAS-2, streamflow, and teleconnections data.
The "Avg" in the title refers to the fact that it uses averaging to infill missingness in NLDAS-2.
NLDAS-2 was available at 0.125 degrees, but we upscaled to 0.5 degrees.  This means there were 16 grid 
cells at the native resolution inside each 0.5 degree grid cell.  Some of these 16 grid cells would be missing,
others would not be.  So long as at least 11 of the 16 pixels had data, we took the average of available data.

## Necessary Code File: ScalingValues.R
INPUT: USDMDataAvg.csv
OUTPUTS: creates data and scalingvalues R objects and also stores these in USDMData.csv and scalingvalues.csv files; 

This script did two things.  First, it created four new variables from the raw data.  
Three are transformations, with ".tr" appended to their variables names:
vpd.tr = log(data$vpd + 1)
apcp.tr = (data$apcp)^(1/4)
ssrun.tr = (data$ssrun)^(1/4)

The last is the creation of stream28, which combines observed stream28 with averages within the HUC 8, 6, and 4
watersheds, as needed. The data with these four new variables appended is called USDMData.csv. 

Second, it computes means and standard deviations of all covariates by grid cell, and outputs 
scalingvalues.csv.  These are used to center and scale covariates to aid with mixing in MCMC, and also 
used to back-transform output back to the original data scale.

Forecasting drought using this model requires fitting a model for the observed drought data (steps 1 & 2 below), fitting a model for the environmental covariates (steps 3 & 4 below), 
then using the output from those models to sample from the posterior predictive distribution for future weeks (step 5 below). 

### to fit the model for the observed drought data
1) Run StageOneDrought.R as an array job where the number of elements in the array is equal to the number of grid cells modeled = 3254. 
INPUTS: USDMDataAvg.csv and ScalingValues.R
OUTPUT:  a separate Rda file for every grid cell; saved in a folder 'StageOneOutput' and named MCMCout.q.Rda; where q=grid cell index.

2) Run StageTwoDrought.R. This first consolidates all of the stage 1 output files and organized as matrices and arrays to be used in the second-stage algorithm. 
Then it runs the second stage MCMC algorithm and saves output in Stage2Output.Rda file. 
INPUTS: MCMCout.q.Rda files from step (1) for each grid cell q
OUTPUT: Stage2Output.Rda contains posterior samples

To forecast drought for the following 13 weeks, the covariate model must first be fit in order to generate forecasts of the covariates that are used as explanatory variables in the drought model

### MCMC to fit the covariate model and forecast covariate values
This model is fit in two stages.  Stage one fits location-specific models to each grid cell, in parallel.
Stage two does the recursive proposal resampling to fit the spatial model.

3) Run stage one of the two-stage MCMC algorithm:
FILE: StageOneCovariate.R; # This script is set up to run as an array job on the cluster, running the location-specific model in parallel.
INPUT: USDMData.csv, scalingvalues.csv #these files were previously generated when running ScalingValues.R
OUTPUT: CovariateOut[i].Rda, for i=1, ..., I.  These are R workspaces saving the MCMC output for the location-specific model fits. Output is saved in a folder called StageOneCovariateOut. 


4) Run stage two of the two-stage MCMC algorithm:
FILE: StageTwoCovariate.R
INPUTS: CovariateOut[i].Rda, i = 1, ..., I.  These are the I location-specific model fits from stage one.
OUTPUT: StageTwoCovariateOutput.Rda contains the MCMC output and also the trend that was subtracted from the environmental variables before model fitting; 
note the sampled forecasted values of the environmental variables are objects in this output file called Ypred.out

### Forecast drought

This file combines the output from steps (2) and (4) above in order to forecast drought for the following 13 weeks. 

5) Run forecast.R to simulate from the posterior predictive distribution of drought in weeks T+1,...,T+13
INPUTS: USDMData.csv and ScalingValues.csv to re-create design matrix X for observed time periods; StageTwoCovariateOutput.Rda to get samples from the posterior predictive distribution of the environmental covariates; Stage2Output.Rda to get posterior samples of the drought model
OUTPUT: ForecastOutput.Rda contains samples from the posterior predictive distribution for the latent Z.pred and also the drought level Y.pred for the future Tpred=13 weeks
